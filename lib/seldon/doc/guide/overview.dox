\page overview Overview

<h2>Basic ideas</h2>

<p> %Seldon provides matrix and vector structures (for numerical computations) which are not part of the C++ standard library. Those structures are a lot more convenient than basic arrays (like <code>float* vect = new float[5]</code> or <code>double mat[5][4]</code>). They can be resized, displayed, copied, automatically destroyed such as the class vector of STL. Seldon vectors can be used along with operators with lazy evaluation. A debug mode is also present, such that the user can correct quickly any error coming from an index out of bounds for example. The use of %Seldon is therefore easy.  </p>

<h2>Example 1 - basic example</h2>

\precode
#define SELDON_DEBUG_LEVEL_3

#include "SeldonFlag.hxx"
#include "Seldon.hxx"
using namespace Seldon;

int main()
{

  TRY;

  Matrix<double> A(3, 3);
  Vector<double> U, V;

  A.SetIdentity();
  A(0, 1) = -1.0;

  U.Reallocate(A.GetN());
  U.Fill();

  U.Print();

  V.Reallocate(A.GetM());
  Mlt(2.0, A, U, V);

  cout << V << endl;

  END;

  return 0;

}
\endprecode

<p>
The example above does the following:
</p>

<ul>

  <li> A "debug level" is defined. It defines the amount of checks that %Seldon will perform. A high debugging level will force %Seldon to check a lot of things (e.g. indices validity), while a low debugging level will lead to less checks but to a faster code.</li>

  <li> Common flags are included, you can modify the file SeldonFlag.hxx to set or unset some flags. </li>
  
  <li> %Seldon is included. Its classes and functions are in the namespace Seldon.</li>
  
  <li> In the main function, the whole is included in a <code>try</code> block (macros <code>TRY</code> and <code>END</code>). This is not required, but it may catch %Seldon exceptions.</li>
  
  <li> A matrix of size 3 by 3 if declared.</li>
  
  <li> Two vectors are defined. Their sizes are unknown.</li>
  
  <li> The matrix <code>A</code> is set to the identity. Then its element at (0, 1) (first row, second column) is set to -1.0.</li>
  
  <li> <code>U</code> is reallocated so that its length is the number of columns of <code>A</code>. It is simply filled with 0, 1 and 2. Then it is displayed thanks to the method <code>Print</code>.</li>
  
  <li> The next operation is simply: 2.0 x A x U -&gt; V. Notice that V is reallocated to have the right size; otherwise an exception would have been raised. If Blas was used, <code>Mlt</code> would call it.</li>
  
  <li> The result <code>V</code> is displayed.</li>
  
</ul>

<p> The output is: </p>

\prescreen
0       1       2
-2      2       4
\endprescreen

<h2>Example 2 - exceptions</h2>

\precode
#define SELDON_DEBUG_LEVEL_4

#include "SeldonFlag.hxx"
#include "Seldon.hxx"
using namespace Seldon;

int main()
{

  TRY;

  Matrix<double> A(3, 3);

  A.Zero();
  A(0, 3) = 2.0;

  END;

  cout << "The program should not reach this point..." << endl;

  return 0;

}
\endprecode

<p> The example above does the following:</p>

<ul>

  <li> A high debugging level is defined. For example, the validity of indices is checked at every access.</li>
  
  <li> Within a try block, a matrix <code>A</code> of size 3 by 3 is defined.</li>
  
  <li> <code>A</code> is set to 0.</li>
  
  <li> One then tries to set to 2.0 the element in the first row and the fourth column. Obviously the column index is out of range. An exception is raised.</li>
  
  <li> The exception is caught, and the lines following the try block (i.e. after <code>END</code>) are executed.</li>
  
</ul>

<p> The output is: </p>

\prescreen
ERROR!
Index out of range in Matrix_Pointers::operator().
   Index along dimension #2 should be in [0, 2], but is equal to 3.
